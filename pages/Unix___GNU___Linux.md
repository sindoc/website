- When a [[humble engineer]] runs a [[Unix command]], they are blessed with the work of individuals who have been involved in the creation, and widespread use of Unix commands. This term aims at associating a Unix command with these three distinct terms:
	- author:: [[Sina K. Heshmati]], [[No AI Involved]]
	- [[Unix]], pioneered by [[Ken Thompson]], [[Dennis Ritchie]], and [[Bill Joy]]
	  background-color:: gray
	  collapsed:: true
		- Bill Joy through [[BSD]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]. But he did so under the larger Unix umbrella. Bill is also credited with the creation of [[vi]], [[csh]], [[Java]], what went on to become [[Cloud Computing]] and [[IoT]].
		- Ken Thompson as the maintainer of the Unix Operating System in [[Bell Labs]], and [[Dennis Ritchie]] as the creator of [[The C Programming Language]] and a huge contributor to the creation of [[The Unix Operating System]]
	- [[GNU]], pioneered by [[Richard Stallman]], or [[RMS]]
	  background-color:: gray
	  collapsed:: true
		- RMS had to recreate [[Unix]], such that he would free it of the restrictive copyright laws that prohibited its widespread use.
	- [[Linux]], pioneered by [[Linux Torvalds]]
	  background-color:: gray
	  collapsed:: true
		- Who created [[The Linux Kernel]] under the [[GNU/General Public License]]
		- Linus also create [[Git]], which was also instrumental to the development of [[FOSS]] and [[software development]] in general.
	- The above list is based on my own humble understanding of things. If I may have dropped some some names, from your perspective, I apologise in advance.
	- But there seems to be consensus over these individuals around the [[ideation]] and [[propagation]] of the Unix [[school of thought]], leading to its widespread use, as of [[1990s]] onwards.
	  collapsed:: true
		- As of this writing in [[2024]], they are more relevant than ever because that school of thought is now the de facto [[operating system]] of [[the entire Internet]], in its diverse shapes and forms, whether it be [[Cloud Computing]], [[Cryptocurrencies]], [[Artificial Intelligence]].
	- In other words, [[Unix]] is a thing, [[GNU]] is a thing, [[Linux]] is a [[thing]] and they all contribute to the overall impact of [[the Unix school of thought]], which also went on to inspire a wide range of innovations that go beyond imagination.
		- But of course, [[within the bounds of the digital]].

- #### You may be asking,
	- ### What is so special about Unix commands, anyway?
- Programmers see
	- ### Unix commands as the basis of any [[automation]] and [[integration]]
	- TODO [#C] Write about automation and integration
- ### [[Principle/More mastered code, more quality time with loved ones]]
	- #### The more computer code you master, the more you can spend quality time with your family, friends, or loved ones.
	  background-color:: yellow
	- Perhaps this is only true in my life, but I have come to understand that as a [[humble engineer]], the more code I master, for instance, commands and scripts and I can pull and run, the more time I can dedicate to spending quality time with my loved ones.
- Somehow, I think that the three of these terms are keywords for fully appreciating the lineage of command line as a phenomenon. Since they have appeared one after the other and each have contributed to the huge success of technology, software, data, and AI.
- The [[computing industry]] would not have been bearable without these individuals. And they clearly seem to have distinct personalities, all of them.
