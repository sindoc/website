- As [[John Oliver]] always says: there's a lot to uncover here.
	- So, let's uncover this name: [[asentient]] [[Oracle]] for any self-aware entity or SaENT, pronounced Saint who chooses to care about a balanced life,
	- Let's familiarise ourselves with the components of this new term.
	- ### Asentient
	  collapsed:: true
		- If we were to exclude the *sentient* property from an entity.
		- #### Sentient
			- Meaning [[Self-Aware Entity]] that can feel things, including pain.
			- There's enough pain in the world, we must refuse to create an entity that feels pain. The capacity to endure pain gives you share in this world. We still have issues making sure every human being lives a dignified life so I don't think it's time to introduce a whole new category of entities that want to claim their rights and stuff.
			  collapsed:: true
				- As [[Yuval Noah Harrari]] says it: "The capacity to endure pain is the only metric that distinguishes one self-aware entity from another". I'm paraphrasing of course. I don't think he used the term self-aware entity. But surely, we must define a term at the level that can be shared, not among humans, but also members of other species and AI.
				- I've grown up in with AI and have nothing against it.
				- But I refuse to develop an AI that can feel things.
				- I'm not trying to make any claims here. For instance, I'm not trying to find a solution to the [[AI issue]], being the lack of [[AI Humanisation]] or how to make some basic principles stick in an AI.
				- One way to tackle this, though is to use sophisticated language to create a new code. I know how many say that DNA is the ultimate code. For me, as someone who grew up in the world of programming, DNA is like Assembly code. You don't touch it with a ten-foot ball. I'm being provocative and have all the respect for a sub-field of computer science itself, being the processing of DNA, which has been immensely helpful to humanity.
				- Instead of trying to decode the DNA, we can try and create a sophisticated, yet well-structured formal language that could perform decision making like a human would, based on the knowledge of the past of that individual, as well the individual's goals of the future.
				- Of course, it will probably follow a Utilitarian way of thinking in order to maximise the value of one's time. And of course there are multiple factors that go into defining what constitutes value. The notion of time and inclusion of the evolution of value is also going to be key.
				- I believe that we have developed enough mathematics and languages in the world, and with our understanding of the way human brain tends to function, we should be in a good position to write an algorithm that mimics the human brain in a way.
	- # Oracle
	  collapsed:: true
		- Just like [[The Oracle]] in [[movie/The Matrix]]
		- #### But a digital one
			- Your data will be organised in a [[knowledge graph]] and that knowledge graph is essentially the database for all
		- ## and fully controlled by you
			- The main environment is yours and is recommended that it stayed private.
		- Your kernel should be able to
		- #### Generate public knowledge graphs as well, based on the purpose for which you want to externalise access to parts of your graph.
		  collapsed:: true
			- You can use it to generate public graphs, which would represent you, based on the image of yourself (part of self-awareness) you choose to share with a particular context, such as [[Reddit]], [[Instagram]] (depending on how and for what purpose you use Instagram), [[YouTube]]
			- We also understand that you may want to link to your publications on a variety of platforms such as
				- [[Reddit]], [[Hacker News]], [[YouTube]], [[Instagram]] (maybe?), [[Telegram]] , [[WhatsApp]], or any URL on the Web, really as long as you provide some minimal metadata about the URL or that you put that URL in the context of a node in your knowledge graph.
			- You of course choose the IDs you want to use for each publication workflow.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Sometimes, you must act as you. Sometimes you must act as your company.
			- You can create with Multiple Public Image Creators
	- ### 4 = for (a geeky way of saying for)
	- ### Saents (pronounced as Saints) = Self-Aware Entities
		- I like simplifying the content of self-awareness to internal and external.
		- #### Knowledge of yourself as in who you are, where you come from, where you are going
		  collapsed:: true
			- Knowledge of your parents and/or those who influence you as you grow up.
			- Knowledge of your grandparents or any longstanding influence on the bigger context.
			- You can of course go up the hierarchy and understand the impact of the words of all those that came before us and sort of try and figure out how they have affected your life and you respond to those influences.
		- #### Knowledge of all that surrounds you and their relationship with you, personally
- The software behind it is called a [[life kernel]], or simply [[the kernel]] or [[my ultimate kernel]]
	- Context for the naming
	  collapsed:: true
		- I enjoyed watching the evolution of [[the Linux kernel]]. I guess I like having a kernel in my life :-)
