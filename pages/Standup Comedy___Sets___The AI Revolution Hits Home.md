- # [[The AI Revolution]] Hits Home
	- ### **Opening: The Safe Zone Delusion**
		- "I majored in Computer Science and AI in college, so I thought I was safe. I mean, whatever happens with [[AI]]—taking over jobs, automation—yada yada, I’m good, right? I’m the guy programming the robots, not the one getting replaced by them."
			- (Pause)
		- "When [[John Oliver]] did a piece on AI and showed truck drivers as the jobs that would be impacted first, I was like, ‘Phew, I’m safe. I sit behind a computer and tap on a keyboard. Truck driving? That’s not me.’ I was so relaxed, I might as well have been smoking a cigar, laughing at the idea that my job could ever be at risk."
			- (Pause, shift tone)
		- "And then [[OpenAI/ChatGPT]] hit the market in November 2022." -> [[Nov 30th, 2022]]
			- (Mock horror)
		- "OMG! I’m like, what? This thing can write code better than I ever have! And I took pride in my code. You know, I thought my code was beautiful, like it should be hanging in the [[Louvre]], right next to the [[Mona Lisa]]. But you know what? No one gives a rat’s ass about the beauty of your code. It just has to work. It’s just gotta make us look good in front of our users. And AI? AI doesn’t care about aesthetics; it just gets shit done. Fast. Like, blink and it’s already shipped your job to the cloud."
	- ### **My Existential Crisis: AI Took My Job**
		- "So what did I do? It’s not like I wasn’t already depressed. I mean, who majors in [[Computer Science]] without a touch of existential dread? But this? This sent me deeper. I took a ‘deep rest,’ right into my depression. Suddenly, I’m looking at AI like it’s the Terminator and I’m just a tech John Connor, except instead of saving humanity, I’m sitting there eating family-sized bags of chips, binge-watching Netflix, and wondering, ‘Is this the end?’"
			- (Pause, mocking thoughtfulness)
		- "And the worst part? People think I’m some kind of wizard behind the AI curtain, like I’m out here tweaking robots and controlling [[The Matrix]]. Nah, I spend most of my time resetting passwords and explaining how ‘turning it off and on’ is still cutting-edge troubleshooting. AI might be taking over, but it’s got a long way to go before it can fix your Wi-Fi."
	- ### **AI’s Invasion of Human Jobs**
		- "Everyone’s worried AI will take our jobs. Sure, AI can beat us at chess, but can it beat us at navigating a passive-aggressive email chain? Can a machine really understand how to tell your boss, ‘Per my last email’ without sparking World War III? AI’s smart, but it doesn’t get the intricacies of human life, like pretending to like Dave from accounting."
			- (Pause)
		- "People are terrified AI will make all our decisions. ‘What if AI picks who I date?’ Honestly, you think it could be worse than your last Tinder date? If AI were in charge of dating, it’d probably do a better job. Like, ‘Oh, you’re swiping right on this guy? Based on past data, you’re about to make another terrible decision.’ And then it matches you with someone who actually has their life together. And you’re like, ‘AI, stop judging me. I know he still lives with his parents!’"
	- ### **The Hype vs. The Reality**
		- "You know, CEOs are super excited about AI. There’s always this rush to be the first one to ‘figure it out,’ so they’re testing, experimenting, scaling—basically throwing money at it like it’s the next big thing. And of course, the hype is real. But then reality sets in."
		- (Referencing the quote)
		- "I read this article where a VP at a bank’s AI center said, ‘An [[LLM]] is like an engine. No one just wants the engine of a car or a plane; they want a car or a plane.’ Which makes sense, right? You don’t walk into a dealership like, ‘I’ll take just the engine, please. I’m good at assembling things.’"
			- (Pause for laughs)
		- "And the same article said CEOs and boards are starting to lose interest because they’re not seeing results fast enough. It’s like when you buy a gym membership in January and expect to have abs by February. They’re out here like, ‘We invested millions in AI, where’s my six-pack productivity boost?’ Sorry, buddy, AI’s not your personal trainer; it’s more like that one guy at the gym who’s constantly on his phone, looking busy but not doing much."
		- "Eric Schmidt, [[Ex-Sun]], the CEO that made [[Google]], Google, said with the current state of AI now, we should just be able to copy TikTok, steal all the users, and ‘boom boom boom’—instant success. Yeah, because building a billion-dollar social media empire is just like assembling IKEA furniture. Just follow the steps: steal users, add music, hope it doesn’t collapse under its own weight, and pray you don’t end up with a few extra screws—or in this case, lawsuits. Who knew the hardest part of Silicon Valley was figuring out the difference between ‘blah blah blah’ and intellectual property theft?"
	- ### **The Energy Crisis: AI and the Environment**
		- "And here’s another thing no one talks about: energy consumption. People think AI is this magical thing in the cloud, but it’s guzzling electricity like a frat boy at a keg party. You want AI to run your business? Cool, just know you’re going to need to generate enough power to light up a small country. And here I am, trying to explain to my boss why we can’t deploy AI to run everything because our power bill might end up higher than our profits."
			- (Pause)
		- "And the regulations, man. Europe’s got [[GDPR]]; you can’t even sneeze without getting permission to use someone’s data. Meanwhile, other places are like, ‘AI? Sure, let it loose! What’s the worst that could happen?’ It’s AI meets Mad Max out there. You’ve got drones trying to sell you a timeshare, self-driving cars driving to wherever the hell they want… It’s chaos!"
	- ### **The Human Side of Tech: Unsung Heroes**
		- "And here’s the crazy part: People worship tech like it’s some alien magic, but they don’t know the real story. Everyone knows [[Steve Jobs]], right? The turtleneck guy, Apple’s prophet. But no one talks about [[Dennis Ritchie]]—the guy who invented [[The C Programming Language]] and created [[Unix]] . You know, without Dennis, there’d be no Apple, no iPhone. But when he died—coincidentally the same week as Jobs—let's just say that almost no-one noticed. The news barely covered it."
			- (Pause, thoughtful)
		- "So we worship tech, but we don’t even know the humans behind it. People think technology is alien. You know what’s really alien? AI. And you don’t need to go 3.4 million light years to find it—it’s already running your Facebook feed, recommending you videos you didn’t know you needed but suddenly can’t stop watching."
	- ### **The AI God Complex**
		- "AI is like the new God. People think it’s this all-knowing, all-seeing force. We pray to it every day—except instead of lighting candles, we ask Alexa to play our favorite playlist. And just like God, AI works in mysterious ways. It’s got infinite knowledge of the universe, yet somehow, it still suggests I buy a book I already bought on Amazon. I’m like, ‘Thanks for the miracle, AI, but I don’t need two copies of *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck*.’"
			- (Pause)
		- "And you ever talk to [[Siri]] or [[Alexa]] like it’s a prayer? ‘Hey Siri, where’s the nearest pizza place?’ It’s basically like, ‘Oh great AI in the sky, deliver me from hunger.’ But instead of answering your prayers, Siri’s like, ‘I found five nearby gyms.’ I didn’t ask for salvation, Siri, I asked for pizza."
	- ### **Closing: Worshipping the Wrong Thing**
		- "So here we are, a society bowing down to AI, treating it like some kind of omnipotent God. But maybe we’re worshipping the wrong thing. I mean, God gave us free will, love, compassion… AI gave us a smarter way to order pizza. If we’re putting all our faith in AI, we’re gonna need more than divine intervention. We’re gonna need customer support."
			- (Pause, thoughtful look)
		- "Actually, that’s the real reason I’m in [[Data & AI Governance]]—to make sure we don’t all end up praying to a glitchy, pizza-ordering God."
