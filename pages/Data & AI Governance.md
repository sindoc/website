- Artificial Intelligence and its advanced capabilities around [[language use]] has given rise to concern over its governance if they are to be used in [[organisations]].
- We intend to study this topic in this graph and provide practical [tools](AI Governance/Tools), to this end.
- ### Data & AI Governance as an [[organisational unit]]
  collapsed:: true
	- An [[organisational unit]] that has responsibility over [[Data Governance]] as the foundation for [[AI Governance]].
	- While AI Governance has no meaning without a solid and healthy Data Governance infrastructure and organisation, which aims at aligning the wider organisation's data operations at *tactical* and *strategic* levels with overall company objectives by making sure that all the appropriate risks are mitigated.
	- At *operational* levels however, AI Governance must be studied and operationalised as a novel discipline, mainly due to **continuous** and **blackbox** nature of AI systems.
	- There are two distinct features of AI Governance.
		- [[Continuous AI monitoring requirements]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- In [[Numerical Data Science]],
				- [[data drifts]] DO happen and a lot more often that desired
			- In case of [[LLMs]],
				- [[Continuous application of AI Ethics]] is required to prevent [[Human Value Drift]] while the AI system is interacting with its users.
		- [[Blackbox nature of most AI systems]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- This simply means that the structure that interacts with a human user in an AI system, is not directly designed by humans and [[the AI response]] is not a conscious act.
	- *Note* that this definition of Data & AI Governance does **not** necessarily define an rigid [[organisational hierarchy]] between teams serving under these functions.
		- However, it highlights the need for full alignment between the type of data governance that is required for a successful AI Governance initiative.
		- ### Example Team Structures
		  background-color:: yellow
		  collapsed:: true
			- In a healthy [[data management organisation]], we could have any of the following hierarchies in two different [[organisations]]
				- Data Management Office (A)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Data Governance Unit
						- AI Governance Unit
					- Data Engineering Unit
					- Data Science & Predictive Analytics Unit
					- ...
				- Data Management Office (B)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Data & AI Governance Unit
					- Data Governance Unit
					- Data Engineering Unit
					- Data Science & Predictive Analytics Unit
					- ...
				- Data Management Office (C)
					- Data Governance Unit
					- AI Governance Unit
					- Data Engineering Unit
