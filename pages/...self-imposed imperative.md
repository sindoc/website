	- A topic we choose to pay close attention to. We often monitor our adherence to it.
	- In the [[Self-Aware Entity]] model, we see this as the logical statements any self-aware entity (self) can make about their world in terms of an imperative they themselves choose to abide by. Sometimes, the imperative even goes against our nature but we choose to hold on to our self-imposed imperatives.
	- Self-imposed imperatives can be recurring, in fact. Healthy routines we want to track about our lives can simply be categorised at [[SII]]s.
	- Note the self very much depends on how the abstract [[Self-Aware Entity]] ([[SAE]]) model is instantiated. Is it a person, a group of people, clusters of people, societies, an entire species, that's up to the instantiation of the SAE.
