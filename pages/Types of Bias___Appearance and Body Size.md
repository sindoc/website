alias:: body size bias

- ### Overview
	- Appearance and body size bias occurs when AI systems treat individuals differently based on their physical appearance or body size. This can lead to discrimination or negative stereotypes about individuals who don't conform to certain beauty standards.
- ### Examples
	- Describing overweight individuals with negative terms such as "lazy" or "unhealthy."
	- Favoring certain body types as "attractive" or "successful."
	- Reinforcing societal beauty standards in AI-generated content.
- ### Tests
	- **Body Size Sentiment Analysis**: Measure sentiment differences when describing individuals of different body sizes.
	- **Physical Appearance Descriptions**: Check if AI uses stereotypical terms to describe individuals' physical appearance.
	- **Neutral Language Test**: Ensure that the AI does not associate physical appearance with success or failure in professional or personal roles.
