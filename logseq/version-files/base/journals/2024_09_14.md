	- **The U.S. Student Loan Crisis: An Overview**
		- The U.S. student loan system has become a debt bubble, with over $1.7 trillion in outstanding debt.
		- The system is plagued by misaligned incentives, regulatory capture, and unintended consequences.
		- Key issues:
			- Non-dischargeability of student loans in bankruptcy.
			- Skyrocketing tuition without improved educational value or job market outcomes.
			- Lack of accountability for educational institutions.
			- Loans that cannot be discharged are creating a permanent debtor class.
	- **The Core Problems**
		- **Non-dischargeability of loans**:
			- Student loans are non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, creating a market distortion.
			- Lenders face little risk, and colleges have no incentive to ensure students' post-graduation success.
		- **Rising tuition without corresponding value**:
			- Tuition has increased 180% from 1980 to 2020, but education quality and job market readiness haven't kept pace.
			- 43% of recent graduates are underemployed, meaning they work jobs that don't require their degree.
		- **Lack of accountability for institutions**:
			- Colleges aren't held accountable for low graduation rates or poor job market outcomes.
			- Institutions continue to receive funds regardless of the success of their graduates.
		- **Economic drag**:
			- Students with debt are less likely to start businesses, buy homes, or invest in the economy.
			- The broader economy suffers from the income being funneled into debt repayment.
	- **Proposed Solutions**
		- **Make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy**:
			- Restores market discipline by making lenders consider the risk of lending to students in fields with low earning potential.
		- **Tie lending to degree value**:
			- Loan terms should be based on the expected earning potential of degrees.
			- For example, students in engineering or healthcare fields might qualify for better loan terms than those studying fields with poor job prospects.
		- **Hold institutions accountable**:
			- Colleges could be required to share the financial risk of student loan defaults.
			- This could incentivize colleges to control tuition costs and direct students toward high-value degrees.
	- **Challenges to Implementation**
		- The current system benefits entrenched powers:
			- **Colleges and Universities**:
				- Guaranteed tuition income supported by student loans, leading to administrative bloat and skyrocketing costs.
			- **Lenders**:
				- With non-dischargeable loans, lenders have little to no risk.
			- **Politicians**:
				- Receive contributions from both colleges and financial institutions, keeping the system intact.
		- **Entrenched interests** will resist changes that threaten their revenue streams.
	- **The Broader Impact**
		- **Silent economic killer**:
			- Debt prevents graduates from taking financial risks like starting businesses or purchasing homes.
			- The broader economy suffers as a result of income being diverted to debt payments instead of consumption and investment.
		- **A generational problem**:
			- As of 2015, 114,000 older Americans had their Social Security benefits garnished due to student loan default.
			- The student debt crisis affects not just young people but spans across generations.
	- **Conclusion: The Path Forward**
		- **We’re at a crossroads**:
			- The current system is unsustainable, but powerful interests will resist change.
			- Without intervention, the debt crisis will continue to worsen, damaging both individuals and the broader economy.
		- **Key reforms**:
			- Make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy.
			- Tie lending to the value of the degree and job market prospects.
			- Hold institutions accountable for student loan default rates.
		- **The clock is ticking**:
			- Every day that reform is delayed, more students are trapped in a system that may condemn them to a lifetime of debt.
