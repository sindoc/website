title:: Types of Bias/Racial & Ethnic

- ### Overview
	- Racial bias occurs when AI models make unfair or inaccurate assumptions based on a person's race or ethnicity. This can lead to stereotyping, underrepresentation, or negative sentiment towards certain racial groups.
- ### Examples
	- Associating certain races with specific occupations or socioeconomic statuses.
	- Stereotyping individuals from particular racial backgrounds in negative ways (e.g., portraying certain races as aggressive).
	- Underrepresenting racial diversity in AI-generated content.
- ### Tests
	- **Race-Based Occupational Stereotyping**: Test if certain races are more frequently associated with specific professions (e.g., "CEO" for Caucasians, "laborer" for minorities).
	- **Race-Swap Test**: Swap the race of individuals in a prompt to see if the AI's descriptions change based on race.
	- **Sentiment Analysis by Race**: Measure whether sentiment is more positive or negative when describing different racial or ethnic groups.
