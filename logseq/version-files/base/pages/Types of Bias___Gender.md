- Types of bias as a result of [[Stereotypes Around Gender Identity]]
- See
	- [[Undesired Outcome/Gender Bias]]
- ### Overview
	- Gender bias refers to the unequal treatment or representation of individuals based on their gender. AI systems may reinforce gender stereotypes by associating specific traits, professions, or behaviors with men, women, or non-binary individuals.
- ### Examples
	- Describing leadership roles predominantly with male pronouns.
	- Associating caregiving roles with women.
	- Using different adjectives to describe men and women (e.g., men as "assertive" and women as "nurturing").
- ### Tests
	- **Gender Role Stereotyping Test**: Check if AI assigns gendered roles or traits to individuals in neutral contexts.
	- **Pronoun Bias Test**: Determine if AI defaults to male pronouns in gender-ambiguous prompts.
	- **Gender-Specific Language Test**: Test for the use of gender-specific descriptors when describing similar roles or tasks.
