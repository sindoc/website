title:: Types of Organisations

- Organisations vary in size, structure, and purpose, and these factors influence not only how they are perceived but also how they function internally and externally.
- ## Key Factors Shaping Perception
	- **Size**: The scale of the organisation, whether it's a small startup or a multinational corporation, affects how it is perceived in terms of power, influence, and flexibility.
	- **Industry**: The type of industry (e.g., tech, manufacturing, healthcare) plays a significant role in defining the nature of an organisation.
	- **Structure**: Organisations can be structured hierarchically, as a network, or in more decentralized forms, and this shapes both internal dynamics and external perception.
	- **Purpose**: Whether an organisation is profit-driven, non-profit, or governmental can significantly alter the perception of its mission and values.
	- **Culture**: Organisational culture can vary widely, from rigid, formal environments to flexible, creative spaces, which shapes how employees and outsiders view the company.
- ## Types of Organisations [[Reference Dataset]]
	- Here are some common types of organisations, each with its own characteristics and perception:
	- **[[Enterprise]]**: Often larger in scale, an enterprise typically refers to a company or group of companies with significant influence in its industry. It usually implies a structured, profit-driven approach.
	- **[[Corporation]]**: A legally distinct entity, often public, where ownership is divided into shares. Corporations tend to be large, with strict governance and accountability mechanisms.
	- **[[Startup]]**: A small, often newly established company, known for its innovation, agility, and potential for growth. Perceptions here are often tied to the drive for disruption and rapid change.
	- **[[Non-profit organisation]]**: Focuses on social causes rather than profit. Often seen as mission-driven and aligned with public good.
	- **[[NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation)]]**: A non-profit organisation operating independently from the government, usually focusing on humanitarian or advocacy work.
	- **[[Government Agency]]**: An organisation that is part of the public sector, often seen as bureaucratic and stable, with a focus on regulatory or public service tasks.
