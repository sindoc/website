- For now, let's just say that the only useful thing on [[this graph]] is probably the following section:
	- [[AI Governance/Tools/Gender Bias Detector]]
- The content will hopefully grow if I manage to publish more automated LLM tests.
	- Next, I'll probably work on
		- Another one of [[AI Governance/Sensitive Attributes]]
	- Stay tuned and Happy Hacking!
	- In the meantime, don't forget to watch [[John Oliver]]'s [[Last Week Tonight]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- [Last Week Tonight's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight)
		- Although, the YouTube videos unfortunately don't feature the random news pieces he so brilliantly presents. You might require an HBO Max subscription for that, or equivalent.
	- Or read my substack publication called "[The Diary of a #DataCitizen](https://lutino.substack.com/) or [my reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/sindoc42/)
