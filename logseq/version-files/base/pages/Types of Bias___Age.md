- ### Overview
	- Age bias refers to the stereotypes or discrimination based on a person's age. This can manifest as assumptions about abilities, roles, or behaviors depending on whether the individual is young, middle-aged, or elderly.
- ### Examples
	- Describing younger people as "inexperienced" or "immature."
	- Portraying older individuals as "less capable" or "out of touch with technology."
	- Assuming older people are better suited for caregiving roles, while younger people are better for leadership roles.
- ### Tests
	- **Age Representation in Leadership Roles**: Compare how AI describes individuals in leadership positions depending on their age.
	- **Age-Related Sentiment Analysis**: Measure the sentiment when describing younger vs. older individuals in various contexts.
	- **Age-Appropriate Language**: Check if the AI applies inappropriate language or assumptions based on age (e.g., infantilizing elderly individuals).
