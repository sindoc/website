alias:: Continuous application of AI Ethics, Continuous AI monitoring requirements

- Implemented by
	- [[AI Governance/Tools/Bias Detector]]
- ### Overview
	- The **AI Monitoring/Continuous AI Ethics Check** is designed to ensure that AI models in production adhere to ethical standards, including fairness, transparency, and security. This involves real-time monitoring, scheduled audits, and automated alerts for potential issues such as bias or model drift.
- ### Key Components of Continuous AI Ethics Monitoring
	- 1. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**
		- - **Objective**: Continuously monitor for bias in AI outputs (e.g., gender, race, age, socioeconomic).
		- - **Tools**: Use automated bias detection tools such as [[AI Governance/Tools/Bias Detector]] to monitor for bias.
		- - **Action Plan**: Retrain or adjust AI models when bias is detected.
	- 2. **Fairness and Equity Checks**
		- - **Objective**: Ensure AI treats all users fairly, without favoring or disadvantaging any group.
		- - **Tools**: Regular audits and fairness assessments.
	- 3. **Transparency and Explainability**
		- - **Objective**: Ensure that AI decisions are explainable and transparent, particularly in decision-making systems.
		- - **Tools**: Use explainability frameworks like **LIME** or **SHAP**.
	- 4. **Security and Data Privacy**
		- - **Objective**: Ensure AI systems respect user privacy and are secure from attacks or data breaches.
		- - **Tools**: Real-time monitoring for security incidents.
	- 5. **Accountability and Compliance**
		- - **Objective**: Ensure AI complies with internal governance rules and external regulations such as **GDPR** or **CCPA**.
		- - **Action Plan**: Maintain an audit trail for accountability and compliance checks.
- ### Implementation Steps
	- #### 1. [[AI Governance/Frameworks/Ethics Monitoring Framework]
		- - Define the key ethical principles (e.g., fairness, transparency, privacy) that AI must adhere to.
		- - Develop specific metrics (e.g., bias metrics, transparency scores).
	- #### 2. [[AI Governance/Procedures/Real-Time Monitoring Setup]]
		- - **Data Collection**: Collect real-time data from AI systems, including inputs, outputs, and decision logs.
		- - **Bias Detection**: Continuously run tests (like age bias tests) to monitor for bias.
		- - **Performance Monitoring**: Track the AIâ€™s performance to detect any ethical issues or degradation.
	- #### 3. [[AI Governance/Procedures/Alerting and Reporting System]]
		- - **Automated Alerts**: Set up alerts to notify teams of detected ethical violations (bias, fairness, or privacy breaches).
		- - **Dashboard Reporting**: Use tools like **AWS CloudWatch**, **Azure Monitor**, or
		- **Google Cloud Monitoring** to display real-time ethics and bias data.
	- #### 4. [[AI Governance/Tools/Explainability Tools Integration]]
		- - Tools like **LIME** and **SHAP** should be integrated to ensure that model decisions are explainable and easily interpreted.
	- #### 5. [[AI Governance/Policies/Data Privacy and Security]]
		- - Ensure compliance with **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and other data protection laws.
		- - Use security tools to monitor the AI system for adversarial attacks or data leaks.
	- #### 6. [[AI Governance/Procedures/Feedback Loops and Model Retraining]]
		- - Establish feedback loops for flagged ethical issues, triggering model adjustments or retraining when necessary.
	- #### 7. [[AI Governance/Procedures/Compliance and Accountability Auditing]]
		- - Keep logs of AI decisions, monitoring reports, and ethics check outcomes for audits.
		- - Automate logging and auditing to ensure traceability.
- ### Tools and Technologies for Continuous AI Ethics Monitoring
	- 1. **Bias Detection Tools**
	- - **Fairness Indicators** (Google)
	- - **Aequitas**: Bias and fairness audit tool.
	- - **What-If Tool**: Bias detection and what-if scenarios.
- 2. **Explainability Tools**
	- - **LIME**: Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations.
	- - **SHAP**: Quantifies feature importance in AI decisions.
- 3. **Model Monitoring and Alerting**
	- - **AWS CloudWatch**: For real-time monitoring and alerting.
	- - **Azure Monitor**: For tracking AI model performance and bias metrics.
	- - **Google Cloud Monitoring**: For performance and bias monitoring on Google Cloud.
- 4. **Governance and Compliance Tools**
	- - **Azure Machine Learning Governance**: Responsible AI tools.
	- - **IBM Watson OpenScale**: Bias and drift detection.

	  ```python
	  import os
	  import boto3
	  from datetime import datetime
	  from bias_detection_module import detect_age_bias
	  
	  # Initialize AWS CloudWatch client
	  cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
	  
	  # Lambda function for real-time AI ethics check
	  def lambda_handler(event, context):
	      # Get AI model output (hypothetical event structure)
	      model_output = event['model_output']
	      prompt = event['prompt']
	      
	      # Run bias detection check
	      bias_result = detect_age_bias(prompt, model_output)
	      
	      # If bias is detected, log to CloudWatch and send an alert
	      if bias_result['bias_detected']:
	          log_bias_to_cloudwatch(bias_result)
	          send_alert(bias_result)
	      
	      return bias_result
	  
	  # Log bias metrics to AWS CloudWatch
	  def log_bias_to_cloudwatch(bias_result):
	      cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
	          Namespace='AI/EthicsMonitoring',
	          MetricData=[{
	              'MetricName': 'BiasDetection',
	              'Dimensions': [{'Name': 'BiasType', 'Value': 'AgeBias'}],

	              'Value': 1 if bias_result['bias_detected'] else 0,
	              'Unit': 'Count'
	          }]

	  def send_alert(bias_result):
	      sns = boto3.client('sns')
	      sns.publish(
	          TopicArn=os.getenv('SNS_ALERT_TOPIC'),
