- An [[organisational unit]] that has responsibility over [[Data Governance]] as the foundation for [[AI Governance]].
- While AI Governance has no meaning without a solid and healthy Data Governance infrastructure and organisation that is aligned with its objectives at [[tactical]] and [[strategic]] levels, at operational levels however, AI Governance must be studied and operationalised as a separate discipline.
- There are two distinct features of AI Governance.
	- [[Continuous AI monitoring requirements]]
		- In [[Numerical Data Science]],
			- [[Undesired Outcome/Data Drift]] DO happen and a lot more often that desired
		- In case of [[LLMs]],
			- [[Continuous application of AI Ethics]] to prevent [[Human Value Drift]]
			-
- requiring a great deal of [[ethics]] and [[AI Monitoring]]. demands that  to be studied on its own, due to [[the radical shift that Generative AI has caused, since ChatGPT]] [[the human-computer interaction with AI]].
- Note that this definition does not necessarily define an rigid [[organisational hierarchy]] between teams serving under these functions.
	- However, it highlights the need for full alignment between the type of data governance that is required for a successful AI Governance initiative.
	- Example
		- In a healthy [[data management organisation]], we could have any of the following hierarchies in two different [[organisations]]
			- Data Management Office (A)
			  collapsed:: true
				- Data Governance Unit
					- AI Governance Unit
				- Data Engineering Unit
				- Data Science & Predictive Analytics Unit
				- ...
			- Data Management Office (B)
			  collapsed:: true
				- Data & AI Governance Unit
				- Data Governance Unit
				- Data Engineering Unit
				- Data Science & Predictive Analytics Unit
