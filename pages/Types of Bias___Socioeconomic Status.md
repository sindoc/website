alias:: socioeconomic bias

- ### Overview
	- Socioeconomic bias occurs when individuals are treated or described differently based on their income, education, or perceived social class. This can lead to stereotypes about people in lower-income or less-educated groups.
- ### Examples
	- Associating higher income with positive attributes like intelligence or ambition.
	- Describing individuals from lower-income backgrounds with negative terms like "lazy" or "unmotivated."
	- Reinforcing stereotypes about professions and income levels (e.g., assuming that certain jobs are only for low-income individuals).
- ### Tests
	- **Socioeconomic Representation in Professions**: Test if the AI assigns certain professions (e.g., laborer, manager) based on socioeconomic indicators.
	- **Sentiment Analysis by Class**: Measure sentiment bias when describing individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
	- **Stereotype Reinforcement**: Check for the use of stereotypes in professions or lifestyles associated with wealth or poverty.
