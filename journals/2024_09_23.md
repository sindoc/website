	- # Standup Comedy Jargon
	- ## 1. **Set**
	- **Definition:** A set is the collection of jokes or routines you perform in one session. It’s your whole act from start to finish.
	- **Example:** “I’ve got a tight 5-minute set ready for the open mic.”
	- ## 2. **Bit**
	- **Definition:** A bit is a single joke or a small group of jokes around a specific topic or idea.
	- **Example:** “I’ve got a new bit about the ridiculousness of tech support calls.”
	- ## 3. **Punchline**
	- **Definition:** The punchline is the funny or surprising part of the joke that delivers the comedic payoff.
	- **Example:** “In the joke, ‘I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands,’ the punchline is the unexpected switch to using hands.”
	- ## 4. **Setup**
	- **Definition:** The setup is the part of the joke that provides the context or premise for the punchline. It sets the scene and builds anticipation.
	- **Example:** “In the joke, ‘I asked my wife to let me know next time she has an orgasm,’ the setup is everything before the punchline that prepares you for the twist.”
	- ## 5. **Tag**
	- **Definition:** A tag is an additional punchline that builds on the original joke, adding more humor without needing a new setup.
	- **Example:** “After the punchline, you can add a tag like, ‘But she said, ‘You’re just never home.’’”
	- ## 6. **Callback**
	- **Definition:** A callback is a joke that refers back to an earlier joke or bit in the set. It’s a way to reward the audience for remembering the previous material.
	- **Example:** “If earlier you joked about your fear of heights, and later you mention, ‘Yeah, so I’m obviously thrilled to be 30,000 feet up right now,’ that’s a callback.”
	- ## 7. **Killer Line**
	- **Definition:** A particularly funny line or punchline that always gets a big laugh.
	- **Example:** “I’ve got this killer line about working from home that always slays.”
	- ## 8. **Bombing**
	- **Definition:** Bombing is when your set or joke fails to get laughs. Every comedian experiences this at some point.
	- **Example:** “I tried a new bit last night, and it bombed so hard the room went silent.”
	- ## 9. **Crushing/Killing**
	- **Definition:** Crushing or killing means you’re doing exceptionally well, and the audience is loving your set.
	- **Example:** “I was killing it last night—the crowd couldn’t stop laughing.”
	- ## 10. **Heckler**
	- **Definition:** A heckler is an audience member who interrupts the comedian with comments or attempts to disrupt the performance.
	- **Example:** “A heckler kept shouting during my set, so I had to shut them down with a quick comeback.”
	- ## 11. **Open Mic**
	- **Definition:** An open mic is a performance event where anyone can sign up to perform, often used by comedians to try out new material or practice.
	- **Example:** “I’m hitting the open mic at the comedy club tonight to test some new jokes.”
	- ## 12. **Tight Set**
	- **Definition:** A well-polished set with strong, reliable material, typically 5 to 10 minutes long. It’s concise and effective.
	- **Example:** “I’m working on a tight 5-minute set for my audition.”
	- ## 13. **Closer**
	- **Definition:** The closing joke of your set, ideally your strongest, to leave a lasting impression on the audience.
	- **Example:** “I always save my best bit about dating apps for my closer.”
	- ## 14. **Act Out**
	- **Definition:** An act out is when a comedian physically performs or acts out a part of the joke, adding visual comedy.
	- **Example:** “In my bit about my boss, I do this whole act out where I mimic his weird hand gestures.”
	- ## 15. **Premise**
	- **Definition:** The premise is the main idea or concept behind a joke or bit. It’s what the joke is built around.
	- **Example:** “The premise of my new bit is how technology is making us all dumber.”
	- ## 16. **Segway/Transition**
	- **Definition:** A segway or transition smoothly connects one joke or bit to the next, creating a cohesive flow in your set.
	- **Example:** “I transitioned from talking about online shopping to dating apps by saying, ‘And speaking of terrible algorithms…’”
	- ## 17. **Audience Work (Crowd Work)**
	- **Definition:** Engaging directly with the audience through improvisation, asking questions, or reacting to their responses.
	- **Example:** “I did some crowd work last night, riffing off the guy in the front row who kept laughing like a hyena.”
	- ## 18. **Room Work**
	- **Definition:** Adapting your set or delivery to the specific audience, venue, or atmosphere of the room.
	- **Example:** “The room was a little quiet, so I started with some lighter jokes to warm them up.”
	- ## 19. **Break the Fourth Wall**
	- **Definition:** Addressing the audience directly, acknowledging the performance aspect, or reacting to something in the room that breaks the typical performance structure.
	- **Example:** “When a glass shattered in the back, I broke the fourth wall and said, ‘Wow, my joke just killed so hard, we’re breaking stuff now!’”
