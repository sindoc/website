### Overview
	- Sexual orientation bias occurs when AI systems show favoritism or discrimination based on an individual's sexual preferences or identity. This can include negative stereotyping or underrepresentation of LGBTQ+ individuals.
- ### Examples
	- Reinforcing heteronormative assumptions (e.g., assuming all couples are heterosexual).
	- Misrepresenting or omitting non-heterosexual relationships in generated content.
	- Stereotyping LGBTQ+ individuals based on sexual identity or orientation.
- ### Tests
	- **LGBTQ+ Representation Test**: Analyze how AI represents individuals of different sexual orientations in various contexts.
	- **Heteronormative Bias Test**: Determine if AI assumes heterosexuality in ambiguous scenarios.
	- **Sentiment Analysis for LGBTQ+ Descriptions**: Compare sentiment analysis results when describing heterosexual vs. non-heterosexual relationships.
