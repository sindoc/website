- Part of [[Data & AI Governance]]
- Implemented by [[AI Monitoring/Continuous AI Ethics check]]
- ### Overview
	- The **AI Monitoring Policy** outlines the *continuous monitoring process* for [[AI systems]] to ensure they adhere to **ethical**, **performance**, and **security standards**.
	- This policy is designed to detect and mitigate [[biases]], ensure fairness, and monitor the performance and reliability of deployed AI systems.
- #### Executive Summary
  background-color:: green
	- The **AI Monitoring Policy** ensures that AI systems remain ethical, secure, and performant over time. By following this policy, the organisation commits to responsible AI deployment and continuous improvement of its AI models.
- ### Purpose
  background-color:: yellow
	- The purpose of this policy is to:
		- Continuously monitor AI systems for potential biases, performance degradation, and security risks.
		- Ensure the responsible and ethical deployment of AI models.
		- Provide guidelines for intervention when AI systems deviate from acceptable standards.
- ### Scope
  background-color:: yellow
	- This policy applies to all AI models deployed across [[the organisation]].
	- It covers:
		- Models deployed for decision-making, automation, and customer interaction.
		- Both internal and external-facing AI applications.
		- Monitoring AI systems in real-time, including bias detection, security vulnerabilities, and performance metrics.
- ### Key Components
  background-color:: yellow
	- #### 1. **Bias Detection and Fairness Monitoring**
		- **Objective**: Ensure that AI models do not introduce or amplify biases (e.g., based on age, gender, race, socioeconomic status).
		- **Frequency**: Bias detection tests will be run on a weekly basis.
		- **Tools**: Use of automated bias detection tools such as [[AI Governance/Tools/Bias Detector]] to monitor biases.
		- **Action Plan**: If bias is detected, the AI model will be retrained or adjusted based on the severity of the issue.
	- #### 2. **Performance Monitoring**
		- **Objective**: Monitor the accuracy, reliability, and responsiveness of AI models in production.
		- **Metrics**: Accuracy, latency, failure rate, user satisfaction.
		- **Frequency**: Real-time performance monitoring will be enabled.
		- **Tools**: Monitoring tools like cloud-based dashboards (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor).
		- **Action Plan**: In case of performance degradation, immediate investigation and retraining will be initiated.
	- #### 3. **Security Monitoring**
		- **Objective**: Ensure that AI models are protected from malicious attacks, data leaks, or adversarial threats.
		- **Frequency**: Continuous monitoring with security audits conducted quarterly.
		- **Tools**: Use of security tools for AI model integrity (e.g., model monitoring services, threat detection tools).
		- **Action Plan**: If a security breach is detected, an emergency response team will be deployed to mitigate and resolve the issue.
	- #### 4. **Explainability and Transparency**
		- **Objective**: Ensure that AI models remain explainable and transparent, especially in decision-making systems.
		- **Tools**: Use of explainability frameworks (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to provide insights into model decisions.
		- **Frequency**: Monthly reports on the explainability of AI models will be generated.
		- **Action Plan**: If a modelâ€™s decisions are found to be non-explainable, alternative models or approaches will be considered.
- ### Roles and Responsibilities
  background-color:: yellow
	- **AI Governance Team**: Responsible for implementing this policy, conducting monitoring, and enforcing ethical guidelines.
	- **Data Science Team**: Ensures that models are built, trained, and deployed in accordance with the monitoring policy.
	- **IT Security Team**: Handles security monitoring and breach response.
	- **Model Owners**: Responsible for ensuring that the models under their purview are compliant with this policy.
	- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees adherence to regulatory and ethical standards.
- ### Procedures
  background-color:: yellow
	- #### 1. **Monitoring Setup**
		- Ensure that all deployed AI models are connected to the monitoring system.
		- Configure automated alerts for bias detection, performance degradation, and security risks.
	- #### 2. **Review and Reporting**
		- Weekly and monthly reviews will be conducted by the AI Governance team.
		- Regular reports on model performance, bias detection results, and security events will be submitted to senior leadership.
	- #### 3. **Intervention Process**
		- If an AI model fails to meet ethical or performance standards, the following steps will be taken:
			- Investigate the root cause of the issue.
			- Retrain, recalibrate, or modify the AI model.
			- Suspend the AI model if the issue poses a significant risk.
			- Communicate the findings and resolution to stakeholders.
- ### Compliance
  background-color:: yellow
	- This policy adheres to industry regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection and ethical AI standards. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
